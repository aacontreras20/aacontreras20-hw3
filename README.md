# Perfect Context Prototype

**Developer:** Aaron Contreras
**GitHub Username:** aacontreras20
**Live Demo:** [Vercel Link](https://aacontreras20-hw3-my6xa4fjn-aacontreras20s-projects.vercel.app)
**PRD:** [perfct.io PRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NEBEHG6nD1d40yFJESZUIPYs2MhXTpv-SNqWSwsMtKw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Overview

Perfect Context is a consent-first meeting companion prototype built for college students. It helps users manage networking relationships by capturing meeting context, providing pre-meeting briefs, and enabling "vibes-based" search to find people using natural language descriptions.

This prototype implements the complete user journey for "Mary, the Student Networker" from the PRD, demonstrating how Perfect Context would help a Harvard undergrad navigate networking events, meetings, and relationship building.

1. **Trigger & Onboarding** âœ…
   - Sees campus mixer â†’ installs app â†’ connects services â†’ sets consent preferences

2. **Pre-Meeting Brief** âœ…
   - "You've met these 2 before" with Madison Chen (AI music) and Sarah Kim (NLP research)
   - Conversation hooks about latency optimization and bias detection
   - Open loops showing overdue action items

3. **In-Meeting Whisper** âœ…
   - Side panel with participant context
   - Real-time prompts and quick capture
   - Demo mode with integration notes

4. **Post-Meeting Wrap** âœ…
   - Meeting summary and action items
   - Follow-up suggestions and email drafts
   - Collaboration opportunity identification

5. **Later Recall (Vibes Search)** âœ…
   - Search examples: "gen AI music person", "the VC into climate who likes climbing"
   - Confidence scoring and result highlighting
   - Comprehensive person profiles

## ðŸ“Š Demo Data

The prototype includes realistic synthetic data:

**People:**
- Madison Chen (GenAI Music founder)
- Alex Rodriguez (Climate VC)
- Sarah Kim (Harvard NLP researcher)

**Meetings:**
- Harvard CS Networking Mixer
- Climate Tech Coffee Chat
- Weekly WICS Leadership Meeting (upcoming)

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Relationship history and notes
- Action item tracking
- "Vibes" descriptions for search
- Meeting summaries and insights

## ðŸš« Integration Limitations (Demo Mode)

The following integrations display "not implemented" messages:
- **Zoom Integration:** Real-time meeting capture
- **Calendar Integration:** Automatic meeting sync
- **Email Integration:** Automated follow-ups
- **Face Recognition:** On-device face memory

These features show realistic UI/UX but alert users they're in demo mode.

## ðŸ“± Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Git

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aacontreras20/aacontreras20-hw3.git
cd aacontreras20-hw3/perfct-prototype

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

**Note:** Build issues have been resolved! The app now builds successfully with `npm run build`.

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **State Management:** React Context + useReducer
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Build Tool:** Create React App
- **Deployment:** Vercel (ready for deployment)

### Architecture
- **Component-based design** with reusable UI elements
- **Context API** for global state management
- **Synthetic data** for realistic demo experience
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility considerations** with proper ARIA labels

### Key Components
- `AppContext.tsx` - Global state management with synthetic data
- `Onboarding.tsx` - Multi-step onboarding with consent controls
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Main navigation and layout
- `PreMeetingBrief.tsx` - Pre-meeting context and preparation
- `PeopleSearch.tsx` - Vibes-based search functionality
- `MeetingHistory.tsx` - Meeting archive and post-meeting wrap
- `Settings.tsx` - Privacy controls and preferences

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions

### Privacy-First Approach
- Consent controls prominently featured in onboarding
- Clear "Demo Mode" notifications throughout
- Granular privacy settings with explanations
- Data export and deletion options

### User Experience
- **Progressive disclosure:** Complex features introduced gradually
- **Contextual help:** Explanations and examples throughout
- **Realistic flow:** Matches actual networking scenarios
- **Responsive design:** Works on mobile and desktop

### Content Strategy
- **Realistic personas:** Based on actual Harvard networking scenarios
- **Natural language:** "Vibes" search feels conversational
- **Actionable insights:** Every feature provides clear next steps

## ðŸ“‹ User Testing Notes

For user testing:
1. Start with onboarding flow to understand consent model
2. Explore pre-meeting brief for upcoming WICS meeting
3. Try vibes search with provided examples
4. Review meeting history and post-meeting wrap
5. Adjust settings to see privacy controls
6. Test Zoom panel to see integration demo

## ðŸ›¡ Privacy & Ethics

The prototype demonstrates:
- **Informed consent:** Clear explanations before data capture
- **User control:** Granular settings and easy data export
- **Transparency:** Visible recording status and consent banners
- **Data minimization:** Only capture what's needed
- **Local processing:** Face recognition stays on device
